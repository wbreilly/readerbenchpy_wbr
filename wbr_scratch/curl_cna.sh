Someone screams, you jump and everyone runs for cover.  Your heart is pounding.  Your body’s reaction to the sudden storm is caused mainly by your endocrine system.\nThe endocrine system produces chemicals that regulate many of the body’s daily activities. The endocrine system is made up of glands.  A gland is an organ that produces or releases a chemical.  Some glands, such as those that produce saliva and sweat, release their chemicals into tiny tubes called ducts.  The ducts deliver the chemicals to a specific location within the body or to the skin’s surface.  However, endocrine glands do not have delivery tubes. They produce and release their chemical products directly into the bloodstream, without going through ducts.  The chemical product of an endocrine gland is called a hormone.  The bloodstream carries hormones throughout the body.  \nWhen a hormone enters the blood stream, it does not interact with all organs in the body.  It interacts with only certain cells that recognize the hormone’s chemical structure.  These are called target cells.  Hormones that do not fit a particular organ’s target cells will travel through the bloodstream until they find target cells that they fit. Target cells then respond to the hormones by turning on, turning off, speeding up, or slowing down the activities of different organs and tissues.  Hormones can regulate activities in tissues and organs that are not close to the glands that produce them. \nThe endocrine system controls the body’s response to an exciting situation. The brain processes the situation and first releases hormones through the pituitary gland.  When the brain interprets a situation as being dangerous or frightening, the hormones from the pituitary are sent to a specific endocrine gland, the adrenal gland.  That gland releases the hormone adrenaline into the bloodstream.  \nSome target cells for adrenaline are located in your heart and lungs. These target cells then respond to adrenaline by speeding up the activities of these organs. It also releases sugars in your muscles to give you energy in case you need to either “fight” or run away from a situation (“flight”).  Thus, this has been called the fight-or-flight response.  At the same time, target cells in the stomach respond to adrenalin by slowing down activity, so more blood can be sent to other muscles. These responses continue until the amount of adrenaline in the blood drops to a normal level."}],"lang":"en","models":[{"model":"word2vec","corpus":"coca"},{"model":"lsa","corpus":"coca"}]}' > out.txt
